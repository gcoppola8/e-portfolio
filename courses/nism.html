                <h1>Network and Information Security Management August 2021 B</h1>
                <h4>Welcome to the Network and Information Security Module (NISM).</h4>
                <div>This module will give you a grounding in security concepts and terminology, illustrated by hands on practice in one of the most important aspects of information security today â€“ network technology. We do not assume any prior knowledge of either topic, so we will start at the grass roots level, providing knowledge in the basics of both information security and network technology. We will use the latter to illustrate some very important security concepts such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, forensic analysis and breach management. We will conclude the module with a look at some of the challenges that face the Internet as we know it today, and consideration of how recent and emerging network technology can be used to mitigate some of the issues presented. </div>
                <h2>Reflection about the course</h2>
                <p>
                    This course has been amazing. An amazing opportunity to research networking, network security, security standards, and tools. The area I looked into with more interest is regulations as GDPR and PCI, I obviously heard about GDPR before, but not having a web application myself I never got the chance to get deeper into it. However, during the course, I got well documented about them, and I really enjoyed the whole process. I believe that this knowledge is going to be very valuable in my career, since for an engineer wider the area of knowledge the better.
Although these three months have also been very challenging. I believe for a couple of reasons, first, the previous courses were more introductory especially the first one, so didn't require that much of an effort, second teamwork, it has been more stressful to work dealing with teammates because I had to take care to be available to meetings, do my part of assignments and be prepared and collaborative during meetings. That was very different compared to when I had to do all the work myself in my time, without taking commitments with someone else. All of this plus the challenge to study for an MSc course, work and be a father at the same time. Anyway, I managed it, and can't wait to get some rest, recharge and start the next module.

                <h2>Unit 1</h2>
                <p>During Unit 1, we had an introduction to threats associated with Information security, we had a case study and discussion about it. Moreover we made our teams with whom we worked through all the course. I have been very lucky at this step since I enjoyed any moment working with my team and I think we made a great job along the whole course.</p>
                <p>My team-mates are: Uzayr, David and Alex.</p>
                <p>My discussion in Unit 1</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The paper Glisson and al, (2015) exposes security risks about medical devices implanted in patients. Those devices are part of the larger group of IoT embedded devices, in this case belonging to the healthcare market. The security problems considered are in common to the whole group of devices with the difference that breaching into healthcare devices implanted into patients can lead to severe physical damages. </p>
                    <p> According to Vinita Malik & Sukhdip Singh (2019) not always manufacturers invest the right amount of resources to protect embedded devices from attackers, due to the necessity to faster launch on the market and low budget for security aspects. When instead security is taken into consideration they have to face challenges due to reduced calculation power that don't allow these devices to process cryptography algorithms that PC, smartphones, and routers support due to their higher capabilities. For this reason, IoT devices and developers have their own set of protocols and crypto algorithms. One protocol used often is MQTT that is a UDP-based protocol. </p>
                    <p> Regarding the specific device tested by Glisson and al, (2015) the threads consist to make the device stop working properly that can lead to the death of the patient if a heart attack occurs, or if the device gets hacked and remotely controlled by an attacker this can provoke directly damages to the patient by activating the device and stimulating abnormal heart activity. Vulnerabilities instead are regarding the use of standard communication protocols are 802.11 x that have known security flows as exposed in Vinita Malik & Sukhdip Singh (2019) and the lack of input validation. </p>
                    <p> To mitigate these vulnerabilities the devices should implement encrypted communications using secure protocols, and input validation that should discard any command that does not conform with a restricted list of allowed messages. </p>

                <h2>Unit 3 - Team work - website investigation</h2>
                <p>During unit 3, as a team we tested the collegues' website following this assignment.<br /> Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as ping, traceroute, dig and nslookup. Use these basic tools to compile a list that details the following information: </p>
                <p><b>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</b></p>
                <p>For this we used the traceroute tool, which is available on MacOS, Windows, and Linux machines. This tool reports information about each hop taken by a packet between a computer and remote host. We initially struggled to get a result using traceroute on the provided AWS URL, however increasing the maximum number of hops from 30 to 64 allowed a full traceroute to be completed without timing out. It took 37 hops from our machine to the assigned website (How to troubleshoot network connectivity using ping and traceroute, no date; Tetz, 2011; Broad and Bindner, 2014; Edwards and Bramante, 2015). </p>
                <p><b>What are the main nameservers for the website? </b></p>
                <p>To find the information on the main nameservers we used both dig and nslookup. Both tools can be used to retrieve various DNS information for a given website. Setting the record type to NS returns the appropriate information. Windows machines use nslookup, Linux machines use sig, and MacOS machines can use both (How to troubleshoot DNS with dig and nslookup, no date). </p>
                <p><b>Who is the registered contact? </b></p>
                <p> Similarly to the nameservers above, the registered contact can be found by using the nslookup or dig tools and setting the DNS record type to RP. These tools did not reveal any useful information relating to the registered contact. We therefore used the whois command(Bruen, 2015) to determine the registered contact- Amazon </p>
                <p><b>What is the MX record for the website? </b></p>
                <p> Similarly to the nameservers above, the registered contact can be found by using the nslookup or dig tools and setting the DNS record type to MX. We did not identify any information using this command, and therefore used the whois command (Bruen, 2015). </p>
                <p><b>Where is the website hosted? </b></p>
                <p> Similarly to the nameservers above, the registered contact can be found by using the nslookup or dig tools and setting the DNS record type to LOC. This command was not able to determine the location, therefore a whois command was performed to determine the location- Reno, Nevada, USA </p>
                <h2>Unit 4 and Unit 5</h2>
                <p>In unit 4 and 5, I reviewed foundamentals of networking, as TCP/IP, ISO/OSI, networking devices ar hub, switch, routers...</p>

                <h2>Unit 6 - Design document</h2>
                <p>In week 6 with the rest of my team we produced the design document as part of our module's assignments.</p>
                <p>The guidelines for the documents were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>List of security challenges (generic plus ones specific to the business).</li>
                    <li>Tools you will use (plus justifications, match them against challenges).</li>
                    <li>Methodology (remote or local, automated or manual, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Discussion on the available models/methodologies/tools and approaches.</li>
                    <li>Selection of methods/tools/approaches.</li>
                    <li>Business impacts on use of tools and methods (scanning in or out of hours, traffic).</li>
                    <li>Timeline of the completion of the task.</li>
                    <li>Limitations and assumptions.</li>
                    <li>Applicable citations and references.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A second task was to review my teammates and my evaluations would also determine their final grade. I found it an interesting method. <br> In my evaluation I really couldn't complain my teammates for any faults. I gave some penalties for delay to the team meetings, and based on individual contributions. <br> And I annotated how one colleague in particular showed more than the others traits of leadership. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately the score we received of 51/100 (pass) was unexpected. And we hoped to recover it in the next assignments. We also got a review from the professor that helped us to understand our faults. 
                   I think a couple of factors are truly responsible, first, we were just strangers to each other, and this assignment was our first real challenge, this aspect improved over time during the module. We did our best but the work and the delivered document was not good enough, second, we missed some important parts of what should have been in the document, so we focused our efforts in unnecessary work, avoiding instead what we should have done.

                <h2>Unit 8 - GDPR case</h2>
                <p>During week 8, I have got the chance to better understand GDPR regulation, and relate on a case study. Below it is my relation about it.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>In the case study: Personal data of a third party withheld from an access request made by the parent of a minor, the GDPR elements in discussions are what information is considered or not considered personal data, and the right of access. </p>
                    <p>GDPR defines personal data any information that relates or that could be used to identify a person.</p>
                    <p>And right of access as the right of an individual to receive a copy of the information stored that belongs to him. </p>
                    <p>Specifically, the legal representative, a parent, of a minor, requested access to a sport club for data belonging to the minor itself. The sport club complied to the GDPR regulation providing copy of such information, but omitted some data as personal name of and address of emergency contact that have being considered third-party personal data not belonging to the data subject. </p>
                    <p>The position of the sport club was that considering Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (the Acts) right of access doesn't allow accessing third party personal data, and being names and addresses part of personal data there was no infringement of the parent's rights.</p>
                    <p>I think after analyzing this case that organization should mitigate this kind of problems by not only storing documents as a whole, by instance minor's form, but each information as individual keeping track of who owns that information and limiting its use and publication to the approved use cases. </p>

                <h2>Unit 10 - Data breach case</h2>
                <p>As a team we continued to work on the final document,at the same time as individuals focusing on data breaches regarding big companies and how they reacted.</p>
                <p>As usual this week has been the most stressful of the whole course, since the big assignment due in less than 2 weeks had to be done.</p>
                <p>Each colleague got to choose one data breach event, I chose the J.P Morgan and chase event in 2014.</p>
                <p><b>What types of data were affected? </b><br />Name, address, phone number and email address of customers' data. </p>
                <p><b> What happened?</b><br /> A cyberattack against a group of financial istitution in April 2014 of which J.P Morgan announced the breach in August 2014 after investigating. </p>
                <p><b> Was the ICO notified?</b><br /> According to the article SEC that is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been notified. </p>
                <p><b> Were affected individuals notified?</b><br /> Yes, the individuals have got notified, but since personal login credentials were not affected, the bank didn't force the customers to change their passwords. Instead just remarked the importance to regularly change any password. </p>
                <p><b> What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?</b><br /> The implications on social level were that attackers could now target customer of the bank with more precise phising attacks, using the J.P Morgan as bait. Beside that they didn't report any other risk for the customers. </p>

                <h4>Unit 11 - final assignment</h4>
                <p>This has been the most demanding week, during this period we completely focused on the Executive Summary final document, I believe after the low score of week 6 everybody wanted to get the best score possible from this assignment, we really focused on the document, how to structure it and how to elaborate the content. To don't make mistakes, we even showed a draft to the professor to understand if we were working in the right direction. </p>
                <p>At the end the result was positive, and this really released the stress accumulated in the last weeks.</p>

                <h4>Unit 12 - Debate</h4>
                <p>Last week I prepared the e-portfolio for submission, reviewing and improving the page that you just read. Then as a team we prepared to a debate with the other colleagues about the future of the Internet. Incredible readings in this week have been <i>Information security management needs more holistic approach: A literature review
</i> and <i>D. B. Rawat and S. R. Reddy, "Software Defined Networking Architecture, Security and Energy Efficiency: A Survey," in IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 325-346, Firstquarter 2017, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2016.2618874.
</i></p>
                
                <p>I can consider this module completed, I am highly satisfied with my work, considering that I had previous knowledge about networking and cyber security, this course has been able, how someone would expect by a postgraduate course, to enlarge my knowledge on the subject, made me reflect more deeply on various concepts and relate on these.</p>
