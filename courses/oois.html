                <h1>Object-oriented Information Systems</h1>
                <p> Information systems are responsible for collecting, storing, processing and providing knowledge about information from a range of sources. Information systems are an integrated set of components that bring together hardware, software, networking, database storage as well as the human process that may be involved. These systems are integral to the products and services that we rely on as a society and as such it is imperative that they are well-designed and developed. Object oriented design and development provides a structured approach to creating sustainable and manageable solutions. The module examines the different elements of an information system from design through to processing and storage. You will explore the fundamental concepts behind object-oriented development using UML as a tool for analysis and design. Further to this, we will make use of Python to provide concrete experience of object-oriented development.</p>
                <p>In this module we will:
                <ol>
                    <li>Contextualise the role of information systems.</li>
                    <li>Understand object-oriented analysis and design.</li>
                    <li>Engage with the issues of professionalism (including coding conventions and good practices).</li>

                <p>During the course I have got the possibility to share, with my collegues, facts about information systems, capabilities but also critical issues occurred and potential. I exposed an accident occurred to me and my team in first person caused by poor software development practices. Most of my collegues shared reported accidents from known companies and how these accidents compromised customers, companies' credibility and sometimes led to company failure.</p>

But without being constrained to stricly follow UML standard since it will be introduced in forward Unit(5). My diagram:<br />

                <h4>Unit 4 - Medical studio appointment</h4> After covering more UML concepts, another assignment made us design a reservation system for medical checks where patients could choose doctors and dates interfacing with a receptionist. The followings are a class, a sequence and an activity diagram for the reservation system.

                <h4>Unit 7 - Mid-module assignment</h4> In this unit I designed an e-commerce system with customers, multiple payment methods, different shipping methods and products, with a focus on the orders status and the states' mutation an order has during a transaction. These tasks can look simple or academical but in my experience are a great tool to track personal progression. More experience I get in software engineer implementing and designing new systems better I become to design solutions, that are more functional and flexible to the requirements.

                At the beginning of Unit 8 there was an exercise with an incorrect database model not in third form, that needed to be trasformed into a 3nf complaint model.
                <img src="images/3rd_normalization.jpg" width="300" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(5)" class="hover-shadow" />
                Then in Unit 8 we started a discussion about SQL and NoSQL technologies, their strenghts, weaknesses and differences. 
                I focused my research on some of the most popular NoSQL products as MongoDB and Redis. I exposed to my peers the trade offs both solutions make to accomplish high availability and improved performance compared to tranditional SQL solutions. It started an interesting exchange of opinions about when is more appropriate to use one or the other tool. I really enjoyed the discussion.

                <h4>Unit 11 - Web development in Python</h4>
                In Unit 11 the main content was web development in Python using Flask as web framework. Of all the material pointed in the reading section I found <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world" >The Flask mega tutorial</a> as the most complete, updated and with a great presentation of the different features of the framework. I never used Flask before, it looked intuitive and in line with the python way. 
                <p>
                    In Unit 11 I also completed the second assignment of the module. To implement the system designed in unit 7 using Python.

                <h4>Unit 12 - Emerging trends in Information Systems</h4>
                <h5>Big data analytics</h5>
               <p>Big data is a set of technologies that allow to gather, store and analyze a large amount of data. It allows company to improve the performance of their systems, but also to analyze the data and find insights to drive their decision. Some advantages of using big data technologies are the capacity to store big amount of data and scale it when is needed, that data don't need to be consistent, indeed it is possible to store unomogeneous type of data, and that data is highly available, so the storage system in its complexity can bear failure of single machines without compromise its functions.
                   One very popular tool regarding data storage is Hadoop, that nowadays shares the market with other solutions like MongoDb, AWS S3 and Azure Data Lake. These tools are used because traditional relational solutions aren't capable to keep up the large amount of data and high availability requirements needed. Once data are stored, they can be processed, each company based on their objectives is going to process data in different ways, to run research on them, categorize them, sell them etc. And as last trend in big data there is the visualization of these data. That means to give to the found insights a good presentation outlook, that can be used in charts, reports including non technical employee who are not familiar with more technical aspects of these technologies. Two very popular solutions in this sphere are Tableau and PowerBI(from Microsoft). 
I believe that this is a big trend nowadays because storage, processing and visualization of data have all a big potential for new developments.
