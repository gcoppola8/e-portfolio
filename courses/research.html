                WOW!! I am so near the end. The stress during this trimester was very high. But this course has been different from the others.
                In my previous experience I never focused on the subject of academical research, and I really liked it. ALl the other courses during my Bachelor and the Master
                were basically always focused on notions and studying with parts of practical experience. In this one instead I learnt yes, but about research, and it was a new experience
                so I found all the tasks very motivating.<br>
                The new skills and knowledge learnt in this course are going to be fundamental for the final project, that is going to require a new period of stress and focus,
                I am aware of this, but it is also the final step in this path that I started almost two years ago and that finally is coming to an end, opening new opportunities in my future.

            <p>ACM highlights a case of abusive workplace environment, in such case Diane is prevented to collaborate
                fairly to the project as her peers do. Her contributions are not recognized or cited and the behavior of
                her technical leader is known to be not professional when a mistake is made, this is especially
                noticeable when addressing female workers and possibly other groups of workers. Diane reported the
                situation to her manager Jean that minimized the episodes reported and doing so decriminalizing the
                detrimental behavior and de facto accepting them in the workplace environment.&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;As
                in (Ebeid et al., 2011) "An organization becomes abusive when it permits or tolerates abusive employee
                treatment by supervisors or managers" and this is exactly the case when Jean didn't take action.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p><br/>Recognize and punish organizations that implement abusive methodologies can be difficult, this
                because law jurisdiction could be limited or because the abuse can be performed as an apparent innocent
                jest especially by skilled abusive supervisor.&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;Instead an effective strategy would
                be to encourage employees to report abusive incidents, implement reviews for supervisors and reward
                based on these. (Ebeid et al., 2011) Communicate to employees and supervisors the importance of a
                positive workplace environment (Ebeid et al., 2011) for the organization productivity and financial view
                point.</p>

        After checking the list of subjects available, I chose to focus my research on the topic "Develop a web application to visualize trends in social media"
        that I am probably going to do during the capstone project of my MSc course. And use the activities related to this specific course to research
        the current situation about social networks to increase my knowledge about them.
        I believe further research to the topic can bring more understanding for the platforms on how to attract and retain users, and for brands and companies to use
        this tools more effectively.

                <li>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</li>
                <li>Quantitative method, because social networks have a very well developed set of API that allows not only me, but also others that researched this field to use them to get precise information about users' profiles, content and social interactions. </li>
                <li>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</li>
                <li>I think that using the social network API to gather information, collect them and then analyze is experimenting.
                    If instead we would be interested on people thought as a product review of what is their experience a survey would be more appropriate.

            The case of Cambridge-Analytica in 2018 has been the biggest data scandal on social media until today. Specifically, the data of 87 millions of users on Facebook that have been
            collected for academical research purpose where then used to run political campaign and influence democratic processes as elections in United States.
            The case generated a series of consequences for Facebook as well. The problem is both ethical and legal, but complex to prevent and manage.
            Was Facebook guilty? Was Cambridge-Analytica doing something illegal? How can we monitor users data and how they are used once these are shared with third-party? <br>
            These are the kind of questions that this and similar accidents arise.

            In Unit 10, I created a proposal for a research project. I enjoyed pursuing this task more than others during these 2 years, always because it was something new to me.
            I think that if executed it can be a relevant piece of information to other research or to social media marketing.<br>
            I am also sure that some other research in going to accomplish this given the amount of interest on the subject.<br>
